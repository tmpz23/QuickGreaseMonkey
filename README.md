It's fonctionnal with Firefox 53.x and www.google.fr ; not tested with others, but you can change header to include your country page.
// Just disable it when you don't search specific things ; there are bugs with # and tab switch and so on ...

A special toolbox is added on the left of the Google page and you can change the results display into several views.
In order :
	1. Compact View 			-> keep the results in the same order and display (rank, title, url, text)
	2. Date View 				-> display (rank, date if present, title, url) sorted by date

Only "Scrap" will use external page ressource with GET ;
The page search is also modified (display by 100, filter=0) ... will improve parameters parsing soon;
Google proxy on urls is removed ; (when you click on results)

NID cookie is http-only so I think can't be removed ;
-> well it doesn't rise captchas when I use it ...
